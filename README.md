   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nurse-tracking-app.git
   cd nurse-tracking-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Set up Supabase**
   - Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Copy your project URL and anon key
   - Update `lib/main.dart` with your credentials:
   
   ```dart
   await Supabase.initialize(
     url: 'YOUR_SUPABASE_URL',
     anonKey: 'YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY',
   );
   ```

4. **Set up the database**
   - Go to your Supabase SQL Editor
   - Run the SQL scripts in order:
     - `scripts/01-create-tables.sql`
     - `scripts/02-seed-data.sql`
